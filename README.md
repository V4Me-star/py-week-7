# py-week-7Iris Dataset Analysis
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of the classic Iris dataset. The goal is to demonstrate fundamental data science tasks using Python's powerful libraries: pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.

The analysis covers three main stages:

Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the dataset, inspecting its structure, and handling potential missing values.

Basic Data Analysis: Computing descriptive statistics and performing a grouped analysis to uncover initial patterns.

Data Visualization: Creating various plots to visually explore relationships and distributions within the data.
